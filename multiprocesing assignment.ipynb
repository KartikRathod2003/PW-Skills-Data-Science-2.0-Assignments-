    "Multiprocessing in Python is a module that allows you to create and manage multiple processes, enabling parallel execution of tasks. Each process runs independently with its own memory space, unlike threads which share the same memory. This is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks, where you need to perform heavy computations, as it allows Python to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that limits the execution of threads to one at a time.\n",
